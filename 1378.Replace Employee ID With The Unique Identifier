select unique_id ,name  
from Employees as E
left join EmployeeUNI as EU  -- left join is used because returns all records from
-- the left table and the matched records from the right table.  
on E.id = EU.id


/* When you use a LEFT JOIN, SQL automatically fills unmatched rows with NULL for
  the columns coming from the right table. You donâ€™t need to assign them manually.*/
